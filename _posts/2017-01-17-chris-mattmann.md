This week we interviewed [Chris Mattmann](https://twitter.com/chrismattmann). You may already be familiar with Chris' work. He's been in the open source community for awhile, most notably as the founder of [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/), and the current Treasurer of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/). As if that wasn't enough, he's also the Principal Data Scientist at [NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), and Director of the [Information Retrieval and Data Science Group](http://irds.usc.edu/) at the University of Southern California, where he's an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department.
