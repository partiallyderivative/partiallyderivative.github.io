    Besla](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/gurtina-besla), who
    studies dwarf galaxies and dark matter at the University of Arizona
-   [Destry Saul](https://twitter.com/destrysaul), who used machine
    vision to find gas clouds just outside our galaxy during his PhD at
    Columbia

    worked on the Hubble telescope, and taught data science and some
    astrophysics at George Mason University
-   [Sudeep Das](https://twitter.com/datamusing), whose work in
    astrophysics at Princeton and UC Berkley resulted in the first-ever
    detection of an elusive property of photons flung towards Earth
    during the first moments of the universe, over 13 billion years
    ago. 

**Some important announcements! **
