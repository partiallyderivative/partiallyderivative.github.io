*This week's episode was produced by Alex Bouthillier at [Apollo Media](http://apollomedia.co/)*

Jonathon recites [romance novel poetry](http://qz.com/682814/i-want-to-talk-to-you-see-the-creepy-romantic-poetry-that-came-out-of-a-google-ai-system/) written by an adolescent AI, Chris digs into the [latest report from the White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/05/04/big-risks-big-opportunities-intersection-big-data-and-civil-rights) about ethics in data science, and Vidya [remembers the milk using robots and lasers](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/watchbot-takes-care-of-absentminded-humans). As a bonus, we listen to some [rap music about linear equations](https://www.flocabulary.com/unit/linear-equations/video/) (seriously, it's awesome).
