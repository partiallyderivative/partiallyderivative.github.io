This week we talk with [Michael Kagan](https://twitter.com/michael_a_kagan). He's a data scientist at [CERN](https://twitter.com/CERN), where physicists and engineers are probing the fundamental structure of the universe. It's Michael's job to figure out how to use open source machine learning tools like [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in the pursuit of new particles at the Large Hadron Collider. Amazing!
