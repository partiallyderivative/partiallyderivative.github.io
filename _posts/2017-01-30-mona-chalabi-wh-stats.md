We wanted to share a quick conversation we had with [Mona Chalabi](https://twitter.com/MonaChalabi), the Data Editor at the [Guardian US](https://twitter.com/GuardianUS), about [an article she published today](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/30/statistics-trump-administration-numbers-manipulation) focused on concerns statisticians have regarding how their work might be defunded or misused by the new administration.
