This week we're talking about open data and collaboration in data science! We interviewed Jon Loyens, the Chief Product Officer of [data.world](http://data.world), a new platform for sharing, exploring, and collaborating with data. Check out datasets like [Hate Crime Statistics](https://data.world/adl/hate-crime-laws-and-statistics) from the Anti-Defamation League or [Global Climate Change Data](https://data.world/data-society/global-climate-change-data) from Data Society, then grab an account and upload your own! 

Full disclosure, data.world is now a customer of [New Knowledge](http://newknowledge.io), the data science company we run when we're not making the podcast. But we knew Jon and the rest of the team way before the platform was public, and asked them to be on the show because we're impressed with the technology and love what they're doing.   

Huge thanks to this week's sponsor, [Veera](http://getveera.com/), a data synthesis platform that makes working with data easier and more fun. Check our Veera, and go be a data superhero!
