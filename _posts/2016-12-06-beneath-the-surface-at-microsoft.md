This week Chris flies to New York City and sits down with three engineers at Microsoft to discuss R, SQL, and why data lakes is a silly term.

First we have an interview with [Mark Souza](https://twitter.com/mark_azurecat), General Manager, Data Platforms at Microsoft on his role helping us data scientists get the data into our little grubby hands.

Second, Chris sits down with [Raghu Ramakrishnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghu_Ramakrishnan), former professor, database luminary, and the man with reported "the coolest job at Microsoft."

Third, we have an conversation with SQL leader [Tony Petrossian](https://twitter.com/tonypetrossian) on Microsoft's role in the world of SQL and its future with R.
