The gang chats about beer data, robot bartenders, and debates whether the webserver [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) rhymes with "engine" or private parts. Also Jonathon totally butchers a French guy's name, and embarrasses himself.

We also hear from [Numa Dhamani](https://twitter.com/NumaDhamani) and [George Richardson](https://twitter.com/g_r_richardson) about the Data for Democracy [refugee project](http://datafordemocracy.org/projects/refugees.html) in partnership with the [Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre](http://www.internal-displacement.org/).
