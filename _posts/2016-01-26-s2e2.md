[Data scientists are
parasites](http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2016/01/21/data-scientists-research-parasites/#2367ad763d1c),
[Snowpocalypse](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/record-snow-dc-blizzard/)
([or is
it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/01/23/washington-d-c-snowfall-total-called-into-question-after-improper-measurement/)?),
and an important public safety announcement from Chris about
[jogging](http://www.techinsider.io/jawbone-exercise-sickness-data-2016-1)
and sterilization. Plus we talk to [Dr. Sarah
Laszlo](https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/slaszlo.html) about
how she uses brainwaves like fingerprints to identify people based only
on their thoughts.
