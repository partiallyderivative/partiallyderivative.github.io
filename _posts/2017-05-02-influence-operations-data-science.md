Jonathon talks with special guests C E Carey and [Kris Shaffer](http://pushpullfork.com/) about their research into "influence operations" -- the propaganda campaigns that are changing the way conversations happen on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and the other places we hang out online. Both Kris and Carey are [Data for Democracy](http://datafordemocracy.org) volunteers, and Carey is a computational biologist in her dayjob, while Kris is a professor at the [University of Mary Washington](https://academics.umw.edu/dtlt/) where he teaches computer science and digital studies.

Here's links to the research projects discussed in the episode: 

- [Continued Bot Infiltration of Trumpâ€™s Facebook Pages](https://medium.com/data-for-democracy/continued-bot-infiltration-of-trumps-facebook-pages-2df82ca86b5b) (CE Carey)
- [The Business of Hate Media](https://medium.com/data-for-democracy/the-business-of-hate-media-47603a5de5f4) (Kris Shaffer)
