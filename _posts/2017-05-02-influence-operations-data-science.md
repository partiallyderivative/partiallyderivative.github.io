Jonathon talks with special guests C E Carey and [Kris Shaffer](http://pushpullfork.com/) about their research into "influence operations" -- the propaganda campaigns that are changing the way conversations happen on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and the other places we hang out online. Both Kris and Carey are [Data for Democracy](http://datafordemocracy.org) volunteers, and Carey is a computational biologist in her dayjob, while Kris is a professor at the [University of Mary Washington](https://academics.umw.edu/dtlt/) where he teaches computer science and digital studies.

Here's links to the research projects discussed in the episode:
