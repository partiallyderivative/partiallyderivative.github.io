Holy crap a mini episode! Yes, it is true. This week, in addition to our regular episode, we are experimenting with a mini episode. These episodes will be personal stories from the hosts about their time on the front lines of data science. In this first mini episode, Chris talks about his first, disastrous, attempt at scraping a website and how Terms Of Services matter.
