We talked with [Joshua Browder](https://twitter.com/jbrowder1), the inventor of [DoNotPay](http://www.donotpay.co.uk/signup.php), an AI laywer that's helped people get out of $5 million worth of wrongly-issued parking tickets. Josh has also applied his natural language technology to [helping UK citizens in need of housing](http://www.businessinsider.com/chatbot-helps-homeless-josh-browder-2016-8?r=UK&IR=T) apply for help from the UK government, and [developed iPhone apps](https://freedomhouse.org/article/freedom-your-fingertips-freedom-house-releases-iphone-app) for human rights groups like Freedom House. Just recently Josh became the youngest member of the [Forbes 30 Under 30 list](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandrawilson1/2017/01/15/30-under-30-europe-law-policy-2017/#7681e3cc683c) in the Law and Policy category, and the Times of London called him [one of the 15 smartest kids on the planet](https://twitter.com/jbrowder1/status/673210491766857729).
