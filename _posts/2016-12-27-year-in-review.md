 It was a pretty great year for data science! As is quickly becoming the best holiday tradition on the internet, we teamed up with Michael Kennedy from the fantastic [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/) podcast for our annual list of the year's top data science news and developments. So grab some spiked egg nog, manischewitz sangria, or maybe a piping hot green tea, settle in, and get ready for the year ahead by remembering 2016 - the biggest gut punch of the 21st century, and a pretty good time for data nerds!

 Huge thanks to Michael for putting this together!
