*This week's episode was produced by Alex Bouthillier at [Apollo Media](http://apollomedia.co/)*

Elon Musk says [our reality is an elaborate video game from the future](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/2/11837608/elon-musk-simulation-argument). Are you real? Are you really reading this? Does this podcast actually exist? We discuss. Also math reveals why [you're less popular than your friends](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/27/why-youre-actually-less-popular-than-your-friends/) (don't worry, it's not just you), and we expore how [data-driven techniques for fighting facism](http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/06/how-world-war-ii-scientists-invented-a-data-driven-approach-to-fighting-fascism/) are different than BuzzFeed personality quizzes.  

**Thank you to this week's sponsor**, [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), who is hiring! If you're an analyst, data scientist or data engineer and fancy a stint in beautiful [Ottawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa), you're in luck! Go solve problems, work with cool tech, and [take selfies with Justin Trudeau](http://i.cbc.ca/1.3244628.1443212897!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/4x3_620/fedelxn-conservatives-20150920.jpg)!
