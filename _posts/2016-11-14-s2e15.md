![Trump vs Hillary](http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/88531728_hi031757035.jpg)

The outcome of the presidential election shocked almost everyone. Most polls and model-based forecasts (like [FiveThirtyEight](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/) and [Upshot](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html)) predicted a Clinton victory, only to be proven wrong by Trump wins in almost every swing state, plus a couple states no one thought would ever go his way.

So what happened? We gathered a bunch of smart data scientists and political insiders to get to the bottom of this.
