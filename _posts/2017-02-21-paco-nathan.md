This week we talk with [Paco Nathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paco_Nathan), who [runs Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceteri/) at [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/) -- producers of Strata + Hadoop and OSCON conferences, along with some of the most notable books on programming and machine learning. Paco also makes his own cider!

Don't forget, we have a new listener survey! Do us a favor and [fill it out](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9S7WVY2). It takes less than two minutes and will help us make a better podcast for you!
