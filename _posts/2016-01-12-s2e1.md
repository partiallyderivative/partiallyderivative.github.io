Sorry for the long hiatus! The three of us have been super busy with our
startup, [Popily](http://popily.com), but before we took a break we
recorded a *live show*! Chris and Jonathon went to hang out with the
amazing data science team at [StitchFix](https://www.stitchfix.com/),
and invited [Eric Colson](https://twitter.com/ericcolson), the company's
Chief Algorithms Officer, and [Eli
Bressart](https://twitter.com/astrobiased), Head of Data Labs to be
guests on the show. They're doing amazing work using data science to
help machines make better recommendations. Check it out!

Plus the audience plays a drinking game where Chris can't say "data,"
and Jonathon tells the story of how he used data science to score a free
motorcycle that almost killed him.Â
