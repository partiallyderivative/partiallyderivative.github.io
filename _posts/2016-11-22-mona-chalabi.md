In our last episode about the presidential election (we promise!), we talked with [Mona Chalabi](https://twitter.com/MonaChalabi), Data Editor at the [Guardian US](https://twitter.com/GuardianUS). Not only did Mona [predict, months in advance](https://twitter.com/richardosman/status/796354294534565889), the surprise polling problems that led to states like Pennsylvania and Michigan unexpectedly breaking for Trump, she's also written excellent articles about [what we've learned from exit poll data](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-exit-polls-data-us-election) and a [breakdown of what the polls the got wrong](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/polls-wrong-donald-trump-election).

When you're tired of thinking about polling and politics, check out [Mona's awesome hand-drawn data visualizations](https://www.instagram.com/mona_chalabi/) and the [Vagina Dispatches](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/vagina-dispatches), her video series dedicated to improving your genital knowledge.
