There's a new Harry Potter book? Are you Sirius? I would've Neville thought this was possible! Turns out it was [written by a neural network](https://medium.com/deep-writing/harry-potter-written-by-artificial-intelligence-8a9431803da6#.dq4bjiw85), so JK Rowling probably isn't out of a job. Plus Chris explains how high school statistics beat the Nazis in World War II, and Vidya makes us all uncomfortable with a detailed explanation of [what happens on the Dark Web](http://www.economist.com/news/international/21702176-drug-trade-moving-street-online-cryptomarkets-forced-compete), the Knockturn Alley of the Internet.
