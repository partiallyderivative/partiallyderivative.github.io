We're doing something a little different this week. Instead of covering
the week's data news, we're looking at how data science is helping with
the very serious problem of suicide prevention. Huge thanks to Glen
Coppersmith, CEO of [Qntfy](https://qntfy.com), for helping us dig into
this topic.

The episode link is at the bottom of the post, but, due to the subject
matter, we'd like to make sure we call out some important information.

If you or someone you know is in crisis or just needs to talk to someone
who understands and wants to help , call The National Suicide Prevention
Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), text the Crisis Text Line (text START
to 741-741).

If you want to donate your social media data to power innovations in
suicide prevention, please visit
[OurDataHelps.org](https://OurDataHelps.org). Your donation, regardless
of your experience with mental health or suicide is appreciated. Sarah
Shuster does a wonderful job of explaining how your donation helps
[here](http://themighty.com/2016/04/donate-your-social-media-for-suicide-prevention/).

Glen Coppersmith
([@GlenCoppersmith](https://twitter.com/GlenCoppersmith) on Twitter) is
founder and CEO of Qntfy (pronounced “Quantify”;
[@Qntfy](https://twitter.com/Qntfy)), a small company dedicated to
empowering mental health and scaling therapeutic impact. Qntfy is a team
of data scientists, suicide prevention experts, software developers, and
psychologists finding ways that technology can create nothing short of
revolution in mental health. You can read more about the company [on
their website](https://qntfy.com) and [learn about their
research](https://qntfy.com/#science). Get in touch with them

Suicide is a large and looming challenge, as highlighted by the [recent
CDC report](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db241.pdf). Data to
support suicide research has been hard to come by, partially due to the
societal stigma around suicide and mental health, and  the fact that the
necessary labels were derived primarily from medical records, as well as
a  lack of quantified real-time measurements of mental health. 

There are some interesting data sets in this space recently becoming
available. If you’re at a university or non-profit, you can [apply for
access to the Crisis Text Line
data](http://www.crisistextline.org/open-data/). The Department of
Veterans Affairs, has also [recently packaged and released a few new
datasets](http://va.gov/data). The US Centers for Disease Control has [a
series of
datasets](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide/statistics/index.html)
that [are relevant to suicide
deaths](http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/) in the US. 

Most of the statistics discussed during the podcast were taken from
[Nock et. al
2008](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/192/2/98.full?linkType=FULL&ck=nck&resid=192/2/98&journalCode=bjprcpsych). More
people die from suicide [than from homicide and war
combined](http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/infographics_2014.pdf?ua=1),
the second leading cause of death for teenagers worldwide, and the
[leading cause of death for women ages 15-19
worldwide](http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/world_report_2014/en/).   
While this is a large problem facing the world, there is reason for
hope. The majority of people who attempt suicide do so only once, and go
on to lead fulfilling lives. Dese’Rae Stage has chronicled stories and
portraits of suicide attempt survivors in her award winning project Live
Through This.

You may have noticed that when discussing suicide, we used the phrase
“died by suicide” instead of the colloquial “commit suicide.” This is
more in line with treating suicide like other medical conditions -- one
doesn’t “commit cancer” or “commit diabetes.” Such subtle changes are a
part of a popular attempt to show respect for the people who are
challenged with these conditions and reduce the prejudice associated
with suicide (see the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis).

\#SPSM is a tech-forward community within suicide prevention. They are
distributed across the world, and communicate primarily through social
media, and are always welcoming of new people. If you were interested in
hearing about the latest research and strategies within suicide
prevention, they would be my recommendation to you. I would go so far as
to say they are the Partially Derivative of suicide prevention -- they
are very knowledgeable of the subject, but make it approachable, even to
those outside the traditional suicide prevention training. They are
active on Twitter under \#SPSM, have a Facebook page, and host weekly
Hangouts-on-air with guests at 9pm Central time. [Check them
