Hello London! Jonathon is visiting your fine city and would love to meet some Partially Derivative listeners while he's here. Come say hi! 

We're meeting at the [Strongroom Pub at 120-124 Curtain Road in Shoreditch](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Strongroom+Bar+%26+Kitchen/@51.5259577,-0.0801095,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xe83a97ace7e8e22d!8m2!3d51.5259577!4d-0.0801095). Feel free to show up anytime between **5:30pm and 7pm (ish)**. Jonathon will be the loud, bearded American man who [looks like this](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/688442167837069313/UVQ0ck05.jpg), and sounds like that guy you've heard on the podcast. If you have any trouble finding us, text or call Jonathon at +1 512 850 5843.  

Bring your nerdy data friends (or even regular friends)! Can't wait to meet everyone!
