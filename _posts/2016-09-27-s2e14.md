Every now and again we get to do some of our research, and this week Jonathon explains some of the theory behind his recent look into the alt-right: a sprawling coalition of reactionary conservatives who have lobbied to make the United States more “traditional,” more “populist” and more white. More alarming is that the research reveals that the group is adopting increasingly radicalized, violent rhetoric, consistent with extremist groups like ISIS. 

At the time we recorded this episode, Jonathon had posted [an overview of the research on Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathonmorgan/the-radical-right-and-the-threat-of-violence-f66288ac8c4#.dkt6kb2gd), and it was more recently summed up in [this Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/09/26/these-charts-show-exactly-how-racist-and-radical-the-alt-right-has-gotten-this-year/).
