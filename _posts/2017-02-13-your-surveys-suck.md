This week we interview survey methodology expert Dr. Frauke Kreuter about how we can design better surveys and where people often fail. We promise that if you listen to this episode you will leave with tangible, applicable knowledge you didn't have before. If you want to dig more into survey design, Dr. Kreuter has a new [Coursera class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/questionnaire-design) and a program at the [University of Maryland for you local folks](http://jointprogram.umd.edu)!

Finally, we have a new listener survey! Do us a favor and [fill it out](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9S7WVY2). It takes less than two minutes and will help us make a better podcast for you!
