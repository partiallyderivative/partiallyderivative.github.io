We're joined by sports analytics luminaries [Sean
Lahman](http://seanlahman.com/), author of the [Lahman Baseball
Database](http://seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics), [Trey
Causey](http://treycausey.com/), creator of [The
Spread](http://www.thespread.us/), a blog about the data science of
sports,Â and [Greg Matthews](http://statsinthewild.com/), author of
[openWAR](http://statsinthewild.com/2013/08/29/openwar/), a technique
for predicting the worth of baseball players. We dig into how huge
amounts of data are fundamentally changing baseball, basketball and
football.

Also, Jonathon has a ridiculous story about building a tweet bot that
spits out business intelligence advice in the style of Eddie Murphy.
Boom!
