Vidya [hates wedding
planning](https://flowingdata.com/2016/03/03/marrying-age/), Jonathon
could've talked about the rise of our [Go-playing robot
overlords](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11213518/alphago-deepmind-go-match-5-result),
[algorithmically predicting police
misconduct](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-now-have-algorithms-to-predict-police-misconduct/)
or the [biggest polling upset in political
history](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-polls-missed-bernie-sanders-michigan-upset/),
but instead digs into the [crossword scandal of the
century](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-plagiarism-scandal-is-unfolding-in-the-crossword-world/) ([here's
the GitHub repo](https://github.com/century-arcade/xd)). Chris was busy
washing his hair or something, but he'll be back next week.

for slowly fermenting beer using local flora, tons of time, and lots of
tasting.
