Spoiler alert! We stand with Ruth Toner, in solidarity [against
spoilers](http://www.insightdatascience.com/blog/fanguard.html). Vidya
discovers a robot that [paints like
Rembrandt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuygOYZ1Ngo) -- is it an
artist? What is art? What is meaning? We'll discuss. Plus, Chris has a
Beautiful Mind moment and helps you avert [the existential crisis that
is waiting for trains to
arrive](http://erikbern.com/2016/04/04/nyc-subway-math.html). 

We're trying out something new! This week we're introducing tips on
software engineering. Love it? Hate it? Let us know [on Twitter
@PartiallyD](https://twitter.com/partiallyd) or by emailing
<hello@partiallyderivative.com>. Huge thanks to [Michael
Kennedy](https://twitter.com/mkennedy?lang=en), host of [Talk Python to
Me](https://talkpython.fm/) and founder of [Talk Python
Training](https://training.talkpython.fm/), for sharing some Python
programming knowledge this week. Here's a [link with more details and
code
examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JaG8FdcguO-ib3HPqEWIbs_8-XZ-KPX3HVP2XGDSD_8/edit)
from Michael's segment.

Massive thanks to this week's sponsor, [Cloud
Factory](http://info.cloudfactory.com/pd/api-driven-workforce)! Go [get
10% off](http://info.cloudfactory.com/pd/api-driven-workforce) your next
project with Cloud Factory's API-powered distributed task platform just
for data science!

Last but not least, we have a quick chat with Adam Smith from
[Kite](http://kite.com), the new AI-powered pair programming app for
Python. Thanks Adam for being on the show!
