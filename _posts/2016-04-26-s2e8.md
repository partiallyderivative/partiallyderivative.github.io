Spoiler alert! We stand with Ruth Toner, in solidarity [against
spoilers](http://www.insightdatascience.com/blog/fanguard.html). Vidya
discovers a robot that [paints like
Rembrandt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuygOYZ1Ngo) -- is it an
artist? What is art? What is meaning? We'll discuss. Plus, Chris has a
Beautiful Mind moment and helps you avert [the existential crisis that
is waiting for trains to
arrive](http://erikbern.com/2016/04/04/nyc-subway-math.html). 

We're trying out something new! This week we're introducing tips on
software engineering. Love it? Hate it? Let us know [on Twitter
