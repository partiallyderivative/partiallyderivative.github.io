We went to the White House to interview DJ Patil, the Chief Data Scientist of the United States. DJ talked with us about the relationship between government and Silicon Valley, the White House's leadership on data ethics, and why the first US Chief Data Scientist was actually George Washington. This was a really special experience, and we were honored at the invitation. Huge thanks to DJ and the White House for making this possible.
