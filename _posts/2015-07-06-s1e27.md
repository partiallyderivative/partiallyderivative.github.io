We interview the amazing [Christina
Warren](https://twitter.com/film_girl)! Check out her work on
[Mashable](http://mashable.com/people/christina/), and two great
podcasts -- [Overtired](https://twitter.com/ovrtrd) and
[Rocket](https://twitter.com/_RocketFM). Also we're in Portland this
week, and grabbing beer at the White Owl Social Club around 5:30 on
Wednesday. Swing by if you're free! 

Last but not least, we'd love for you guys to be the first to use
[Popily](http://popily.com), the new app we rolled out late last month.
Email us at **awesome@popily.com** if you want to try it out with your
own data.
