This week the gang is back with another episode! This week Jonathon discusses the academic smackdown between [Riza Berkin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-hyping-why-deep-learning-cannot-applied-easily-berkan-ph-d?trk=hp-feed-article-title-comment) and [Yannick Versley](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/neural-networks-quite-neat-reply-riza-berkan-yannick-versley?deepLinkCommentId=6221869083437072384&anchorTime=1483409186231&trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_REPLY_TOP_LEVEL_COMMENT), Vidya discovers that [AI can make AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603381/ai-software-learns-to-make-ai-software/) and we are all doomed, and Chris talks about algorithmic accountability and remembers that [Frogger exists](https://qz.com/888529/this-ai-translates-its-internal-monologue-for-humans-to-understand-and-plays-frogger/).
