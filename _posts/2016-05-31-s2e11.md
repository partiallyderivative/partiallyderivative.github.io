*This week's episode was produced by Alex Bouthillier at [Apollo Media](http://apollomedia.co/)*

Jonathon learns [breakfast is a sham](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/upshot/sorry-theres-nothing-magical-about-breakfast.html?smid=tw-upshotnyt&smtyp=cur&_r=1), Chris embraces [the quantified burrito](https://sxcole.com/2016/05/22/100-burritos-in-san-diego-10-dimensional-rating-system/), and Vidya reveals what we've known all along, [data science proves that drinking is fun](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/24/scientists-have-figured-out-exactly-how-much-fun-it-is-to-get-drunk/). We also get down and get func-y (_see what we did there?_) with [Excel Func](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhK6D05EamE), a cover of Uptown Funk for stats nerds.
