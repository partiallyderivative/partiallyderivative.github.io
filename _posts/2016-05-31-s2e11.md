*This week's episode was produced by Alex Bouthillier at [Apollo Media](http://apollomedia.co/)*

Jonathon learns [breakfast is a sham](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/upshot/sorry-theres-nothing-magical-about-breakfast.html?smid=tw-upshotnyt&smtyp=cur&_r=1), Chris embraces [the quantified burrito](https://sxcole.com/2016/05/22/100-burritos-in-san-diego-10-dimensional-rating-system/), and Vidya reveals what we've known all along, [data science proves that drinking is fun](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/24/scientists-have-figured-out-exactly-how-much-fun-it-is-to-get-drunk/). We also get down and get func-y (_see what we did there?_) with [Excel Func](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhK6D05EamE), a cover of Uptown Funk for stats nerds.

**Thank you to this week's sponsor**, [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), who is hiring! If you're an analyst, data scientist or data engineer and fancy a stint in beautiful [Ottawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa), you're in luck! Go solve problems, work with cool tech, and [take selfies with Justin Trudeau](http://i.cbc.ca/1.3244628.1443212897!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/4x3_620/fedelxn-conservatives-20150920.jpg)!
